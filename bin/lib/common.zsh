# backupd writes a per-pass summary at INFO level -- items added and the size of

# it is what landed on the destination.
#
# Two hard limits shape this, and both are why it is cached rather than read:
#
#   Cost.      `log show --info` runs 1.0-1.4s. The menu bar renders every ten
#              minutes; paying that there would make the monitor a source of
#              the load it exists to watch for.
#   Retention. The info-level store keeps roughly 15 hours. Measured: a 3-day
#              window returns byte-identical output to a 12-hour one. So this
#              is blank precisely when backups have been failing for days --
#              which is exactly when it matters least, the Backup age row
#              having already gone CRIT by then.
#
# Cached against the backup it describes, not against a clock: one backup, one
# lookup, forever. A backup whose log has aged out is recorded as unavailable

# images, package caches and toolchains are all reconstructible from a registry
# or a lockfile, but Time Machine copies them like anything else -- inflating
# both the byte count and, worse, the FILE count that dominates a network
# backup's cost. On the host this came from, ~60 GB of exactly this was going to
# a NAS over Wi-Fi, with backupd burning 173% CPU at 7.5 files/sec.
#
# Docker.raw deserves special mention: one 22 GB sparse image, rewritten on every
# container run, so every incremental re-copies large chunks of it.
#
# Only genuinely reconstructible paths belong here. Anything a user might have
# hand-curated (documents, Downloads, photo libraries) must never be suggested.
