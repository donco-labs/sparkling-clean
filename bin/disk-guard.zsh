#
# `log show --info` runs about a second, so it is not something to re-pay on
# every render -- but the cache is keyed to the BACKUP, not to a clock, so a
# stale cache means a backup has completed since the last run. That is hourly at
# most. Waiting for it costs a second an hour; the renders in between still pay
# nothing, which is the trade the detached refresh was protecting.
#
# This used to sit below sc_run_health_checks and only launch the refresh, so
# the figures always landed one run late. On an hourly backup against a
# ten-minute menu bar that left the Backup row showing a time with no size for a
# whole render window after every backup -- about one look in six, which reads
# as a missing feature rather than a pending one.
#
# ORDER IS THE POINT: sc_run_health_checks builds the Backup row's headline and
# detail from this cache, so a refresh that finishes after it has run cannot
# reach this pass. Anything warming the cache has to go above this line.
#
# The launch stays fully detached so that giving up on the wait does not kill
# the refresh: it finishes on its own and the figures are there next run.
