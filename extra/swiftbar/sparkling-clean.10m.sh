# Reads disk-guard --json (~0.4s). It deliberately does NOT run the full report,
# which walks 100k-entry trees with find(1) and takes tens of seconds — far too
# slow for something the menu bar re-runs every ten minutes.
#
# Nothing here needs sudo or Full Disk Access: every check behind it is
# read-only and unprivileged by design.

# Row colour rides in the text as an ANSI escape, not in the `color=` parameter,
# because on macOS 26 SwiftBar (2.1.2b3) renders every row as an attributed
# title and wraps a `color=`-styled one in a tracking subclass:
#
#     item.attributedTitle = if params.color != nil, !params.ansi {
#         MenuTrackingAttributedTitle(titleWithImage)
#
# That subclass forces NSColor.selectedMenuItemTextColor over the row while the
# pointer is on it. Un-highlighting flips the flag back and calls itemChanged(),
# which on macOS 26 does not make AppKit re-read the title -- so the row keeps
# the highlight colour until the whole menu is rebuilt. An orange WARN went dark
# on rollover and stayed dark until the menu was closed and reopened.
#
# An ANSI-coloured row is exempt from that wrapper. `color=` stays on every row
# anyway: SwiftBar gives a row a target only when it has an action OR a colour,
# and a row with no target is auto-disabled -- dimmed, and refusing to highlight.
# Verified in SwiftBar on 2026-09-11: ANSI rows survive rollover, param-coloured
# rows do not, and an ANSI row without `color=` renders washed out.
#
# Indices rather than names, because SwiftBar's 256-colour table is its own
# arithmetic: these three resolve to rgb(255,135,0), pure red, and #808080.
